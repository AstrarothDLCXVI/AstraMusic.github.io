I should've told you
When I had the chance
Lost in the memories we don't have
I wanted to hold you
In hopeless romance
Mm, you fade like a ghost

I've been from London to Aberdeen (wow)
Inside a coup√©
And from inside a private limousine (cool?)
Do you think it really matters if I wear designer? (No)
'Cause I don't
If I don't have her what's the point of finer (things, things, things)
I'm ex nihilo like Augustine (amen)
But I confess
I haven't been the best internally (why not?)
I keep seeing two moons in my dreams (again?)
Can you tell me what they really mean?

I should've told you
When I had the chance
Lost in the memories we don't have
I wanted to hold you
In hopeless romance
Mmm, you fade like a ghost

Can you catch me when I fall? (fall)
I'm in love with the idea (idea)
Of who you are
(I'm in love with a lie)
I tried to look the other way (way)
But I'm lying to myself (myself)
I never wanted it to end

I had no other option
I had to find a way to leave before you walked in
At the end the chase was all I really wanted
But it's too late for that
You give heart attacks
And I find It hard to sleep (it's hard to sleep)
'Cause I'm afraid of ghosts
And I can hear you talking (blah, blah, blah)
So perpetual
You showed no sign of stopping (stop)
It's too late for that (fuck)
Can't you understand?

Ah

I should've told you (told you, told you)
When I had the chance (I had the chance, I had the chance)
Lost in the memories we don't have (we never had, we never had)
I wanted to hold you (I wanna hold you, I wanna hold you)
In hopeless romance (hopeless romance)
Mmm, you fade like a ghost (like a ghost, like a ghost)

(You fade like a ghost, you fade like a ghost)

You could at least just make it easy (easy)
You know I hate being so needy (needy)
Got my attention on a leash
And I don't want it back
Unintentionally acting creppy (creppy)
In front of her but she can't see me (can't see)
I think she thinks I'm on the spectrum
I'm pretty sure she wants to leave (wants to leave)
And I don't blame her
